Follow these steps to make a contribution:


### 📌 Step 1

### 📌 Step 3
Add an upstream link to main branch in your cloned repo
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/CommunityPro/support.git
```

### 📌 Step 4
Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

```

```

### 📌 Step 7
Push the changes for review 
```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### 📌 Step 8
Create a PR on Github. (Don't just hit the create a pull request button, you must write a PR message to clarify why and what you are contributing)

### Note:

> - Do not edit/delete someone else's code in this repository. You can only insert new files/folder in this repository.
> - Fix linting changes before committing.  
> - Give a meaningful name to whatever file or folder you are adding.

## What should I keep in mind while contributing?💡
- When you are contributing, make sure that the work is entirely your own and not from some other source.
- All the scripts must follow [PEP 8 Style Guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
